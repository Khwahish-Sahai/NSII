SAI has played a significant role in shaping Indiaâ€™s sports development by providing training to elite athletes and at the same time operating a number of schemes for the identification and development of young talent. The schemes are being implemented through various regional centres and training centres of SAI spread throughout the country. In addition to that, a number of academic programmes in physical education and sports are also offered by SAI. SAI is also entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining and utilizing, on the behalf of Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, the following Stadia in Delhi which were constructed/renovated for the IX Asian Games held in New Delhi in 1982.

<br>
<br>
<font color="White" size="+2">The Come & Play Scheme was initiated for optimum utilization of Sports Authority of India's sports facilities in Delhi and across the country, and primarily focused on encouraging local sports persons in areas where SAI sports facilities/Centres are operational. You can find information related to selection criterion, disciplines covered, fee structure, etc. Users can download application form to apply for the scheme. Guidelines document is also available.
<br>
<br>
The Come & Play Scheme was initiated for optimum utilization of SAI sports facilities in Delhi and across the country, and primarily focussed on encouraging local sports persons in areas where SAI sports facilities/Centres are operational. While providing youth from local communities and sports enthusiasts with an opportunity to train under SAI coaches, the scheme provides yet another avenue for those not covered under regular residential/ non-residential schemes. The scheme creates yet another pool of talented sportspersons from where meritorious sportspersons can be scouted and inducted into regular residential sports promotional schemes of STC and SAG.
<br>
<br>
The Scheme was initiated at various SAI Stadium Complexes in Delhi, in phases, in May, 2011. The enthusiasm and overwhelming response for the scheme encouraged SAI to launch this Scheme at its various Regional Centres/Sub Centres/Academic Institutions/STC and SAG Centres from 1st October 2011.
<br>
<br>
 Information/ intimation is provided to various district, block, local authorities and the District Education Officers/District Sports Officers as also Headmasters/Principals of schools/colleges in and around SAI Centres so that maximum number of trainees are made aware of the facilities available, thereby enabling them to access it better.
